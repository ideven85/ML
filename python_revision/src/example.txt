**Note:** This example is simplified and doesn't cover all the features of the `pytorrent` package. You may need to add additional
code to handle errors, manage the torrent's progress, or interact with the client in more complex ways.

Some possible use cases for this script include:

* Sharing files with others over a network
* Creating a simple P2P application using Python
* Testing and debugging the `pytorrent` package

Keep in mind that sharing files with others using P2P can be complex and may involve issues like copyright infringement, bandwidth
consumption, or security risks. Make sure to use this script responsibly and follow all applicable laws and regulations.
